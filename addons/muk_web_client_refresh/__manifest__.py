    "description": """ 
        Adds a "refresh" channel to the web client,
        which can be used to trigger a view refresh without refreshing the
        browser itself. Furthermore, it allows the user the creation of
        "refresh" rules. These rules can be applied to any Odoo model and
        trigger a refresh either on create, write or unlink.
